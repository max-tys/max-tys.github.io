    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>This web application allows you to keep track of your stocks, ETFs, and other financial instruments. Thanks to the <a href="https://finnhub.io/" target="_blank">Finnhub Stock API</a>, real-time prices are available for US stocks, forex and crypto. I built this application with Ruby on Rails, and it is backed by a PostgreSQL database.</p>

    <p>This case study will outline the development process, highlight some of the technical challenges I encountered, and explain the approach I took to overcome those issues.</p>

    <h2>Request / Response Cycle in Rails</h2>

    <p>Let&#39;s begin with an brief tour of how the application works.</p>

    <p>Rails uses the popular Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. This means it separates and assigns the various functionalities or concerns of the application to each of the three MVC components. In a nutshell:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>the Model communicates with the database;</li>
      <li>the View generates the page to be displayed by the browser; and</li>
      <li>the Controller acts as the middleman between the Model and the View.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>When someone sends a request for the root path <code>/</code> to the Rails server, the first order of business is to figure out which controller, or more specifically, the method or <em>action</em> within the controller, is responsible for handling that request.</p>
      
    <p>To that end, Rails looks to <code>config/routes.rb</code>, which functions as the mailroom of the application. It contains a list of mappings between the requests and the controller actions. In this application, the request for the root path is handled by the <code>index</code> method of the <code>Portfolios</code> controller.</p>

    <p>I have designed the homepage to dynamically display a list of portfolios. This includes information about their respective investment costs, market values, and the unrealized gains and losses. Since the page is not static, the controller needs the model&#39;s help to retrieve the financial information stored in the database. </p>

    <p>The model fetches the data accordingly and hands it over to the controller. Now that the controller has all the information it needs to handle the request, it forwards them to the view in the form of instance variables, e.g. <code>@portfolios</code>.</p>

    <p>Finally, the view blends the instance variables and the static HTML elements seamlessly into a <code>.html</code> file and serves it as part of the response to the browser.</p>

    <h2>Defining the Schema and the Routes</h2>

    <p>The conceptual schema is relatively straightforward. Each portfolio can have multiple holdings, and each holding can have multiple transactions. I created three Active Record models to represent each of the relations. When a portfolio is deleted, all its associated holdings and transactions will be removed from the database too. This can easily be achieved by adding the <code>dependent: :destroy</code> option to the model.</p>

    <p>As for the routes, I utilised <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html#resource-routing-the-rails-default" target="_blank">resource routing</a> to declare the standard RESTful routes quickly. To simplify the otherwise unwieldy paths, I chose to nest the resources in a <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html#shallow-nesting"  target="_blank">shallow</a> manner. And since the models have been <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html#why-associations-questionmark" target="_blank">associated</a> with each other, we can easily refer to their parent or child objects with the <a href="https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Associations/ClassMethods.html" target="_blank">class methods provided by Rails</a>. These methods obviate the need to retrieve the relevant id from a deeply nested path.</p>

    <h2>Reducing External API Calls</h2>

    <p>The application&#39;s dependency on an external API greatly limits its scalability. In particular, a free user of the Finnhub Stock API is limited to only <a href="https://finnhub.io/pricing" target="_blank">60 API calls per minute</a>. If I had just three portfolios containing 10 holdings each, the rate limit would be exceeded by refreshing the homepage twice or more in a minute.</p>

    <p>There are at least two ways to reduce the number of API calls in this application. One option is to optimize the code to eliminate any unnecessary calls. The other is to cache frequently used data. Since it is currently <a href="https://github.com/finnhubio/Finnhub-API/issues/165" target="_blank">not possible to obtain data about multiple stocks in a single API call</a>, I decided to use <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/caching_with_rails.html#low-level-caching" target="_blank">low level caching</a> and store the results of the API calls in <code>Rails.cache</code>.</p>

    <p>Rails provides a convenient way of retrieving and storing data in the cache, namely the <code>Rails.cache.fetch</code> method. If there is a cached value for a given key, Rails will return that value. On the other hand, if there is a cache miss, Rails will make an API call by executing the block passed to <code>fetch</code> and store the Finnhub data in the cache.</p>

    <pre><code class="ruby">Rails.cache.fetch(holding.id.to_s, expires_in: 60.seconds) do
  finnhub_client.quote(holding.symbol).c
end</code></pre>

    <p>Having said that, we need to weigh the tradeoffs involved with caching. In order to strike an appropriate balance between (1) the need to improve scalability against (2) the need to serve up-to-date data, I configured the cache to expire after 60 seconds. This can of course be adjusted up or down to meet the user&#39;s needs. Another solution would be to add a &#39;Refresh&#39; button to allow users to update the data on demand.</p>

    <p>Before leaving this topic, it bears mentioning that another major benefit of caching was to improve performance and page load times significantly. For a relatively small database containing 15 holdings held across 3 separate portfolios, caching reduced the response time for the <code>Portfolio#index</code> page by about <strong>97%</strong>! The first request took 1,070ms - most of the latency can be attributed to the external API calls - but the second request only took 29ms because the data from Finnhub had already been stored in the cache.</p>

    <h2>Future Work</h2>

    <p>To conclude this case study, I would like to highlight some opportunities to enhance this application:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Add the ability to sell. At the moment, the platform only keeps track of what you&#39;ve bought, and we can only simulate the selling of a stock by modifying or deleting the transaction. This feature can be implemented in part by adding a column in the transactions table to indicate whether it was a sale or a purchase.</li>
      <li>Expand on the breadth and depth of financial data available through this platform, e.g. dividend payout dates, 52-week highs and lows, annualized profits or losses. Most of these can be retrieved with additional API calls or computed manually from the existing data.</li>
      <li>Visualize the portfolio holdings. The weighted distribution of stocks can be displayed in a pie chart, and the performance of a holding over time can be tracked in a line graph.</li>
    </ul>
